# Literature-Survey-Spatio-Temporal-Visualization

A spatio-temporal visualization literature survey that examines spatio-temporal visualization techniques
that use maps or similar visualizations to display traffic related spatio-temporal data. The paper explores the use of heatmap and 3D GIS to visualize spatio temporal data and explains how we can identify anomalies and patterns using the visualizations and machine learning techniques.

## Abstract

With the exponential growth in the number of mobile devices and apps
to help collect user data such as location and time, there has been growing
opportunities to analyze these user data and understand the user's behav-
ior by performing an in-depth analysis with statistical methods and visual
techniques such as spatio-temporal visualization. The development of new
software and customizable libraries has provided us the means and capac-
ity to easily display user data such as spatio-temporal data with a more
sophisticated, customizable visualization technique. In this survey, we
examine previously researched techniques for visualizing spatio-temporal
data and identify some of the weaknesses of the techniques and suggest
how we can make an improvement with today's technology. Lastly, we
will explore some of the designs of visual and statistic analysis that can
be used to understand and explain patterns and anomalies that can be
found from spatio-temporal visualizations.
